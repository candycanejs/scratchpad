# Candycane Scratchpad

This application is an basic consuming application using Candycane with Candycane CLI.
As parts of the application are abstracted into the major library, this will become more svelt and patterns will begin to appear.
Until then, this project will likely be a bit of a mess.

## Trying Candycane NOW!

> So you know this is WIP and still want to try it out? OK. Don't say I didn't warn you!

Start by installing the Candycane CLI and cloning this application locally:

```
npm install -g candycane-cli
git clone git@github.com:candycanejs/scratchpad.git
```

Then move into the new directory and run:

```
npm install
```

Then to launch the project run:

```

```
